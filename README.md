# Digital-Image-Processing-ECN316-Project
To run the Matlab code download the folder as it is. All paths are relative so there is no need to
change paths in the code. Here is a brief description of each code

● notch_filter.m - It runs to code to remove periodic noise from noiseball.png

● notch.m - This code implements notch filter

● notch_news.m - It runs the code to remove moire pattern from a newspaper clipping

● motion_blur.m - Implements the model of motion blur

● atmospheric_turbelence.m - Implements the model of atmospheric turbulence

● add_motion_blur.m - Adds motion blur to the image

● add_turebelence.m - Adds atmospheric turbulence to the image

● remove_motion_blur.m - Removes motion blur by using Weiner filtering

● remove_motion_blur_limited.m - Removes motion blur by limiting the value of
degradation function

● remove_turbelence.m - Removes atmospheric turbulence from the image using Weiner
filtering

● dftuv.m - Function taken from http://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/425/Lab5/index.html. It is used to
calculate the distance in shifted Fourier Transform

● lpfilter.m - Function taken from http://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/425/Lab5/index.html. It
implements different kinds of low pass filters.
